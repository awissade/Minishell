o Minishelnishell" project is all about building your very own shell—like a miniature version of Bash! 🖥️ You will be diving deep into system calls and process management while learning how shells work. Your goal is to develop a shell that reads and executes commands with proper prompt handling, working history, and environment variable expansion 🌍. Along the way, you’ll handle pipes, redirections, and even implement a few Bash-like built-in commands, including echo, cd, pwd, export, and more. ⚙️

The project emphasizes building a robust, memory-efficient shell while handling complex operations like signal processing and piping multiple commands. 🛠️l
